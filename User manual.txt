You can only attempt to flip cards when its your turn. You're allowed to pick only 2 cards. After that,
you switch turns with the other player even if you matched a pair.
You can quit the game when it's your turn by first pressing the QUIT button, and then closing the window.
The game is over when one of the player quits or when all cards have been matched.
If all cards have been matched, the player who has more matched pairs wins. If both players scored the same,
the player who connected last wins. There are no draws.

The usage of command line arguments:

If no command line arguments are provided, the client by default uses images as the values of cards
from images directory. It connects to localhost as the server of the program by default.
It supports following options:

-help
	Displays the correct usage of the program.

-server hostAddr
	Sets the address of the server

-img NONE |  dirPath
	If set to NONE, numbers are used instead of images. Otherwise, creates a directory path
	with the images to be used as faces of cards. Filenames of images must be numbers between 0 and 10.
	It adds ".jpg" to the filenames by default, so only .jpg images can be used. The trailing '/' is added
	to the directory path automatically, so it does not need to be provided through the command line.
	The name of the image which is used as a back of the card must be "PlayerBackOfCard".
